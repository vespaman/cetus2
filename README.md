The connectors.ods contains pinout of the big mainboard ribbon cable connector, as well has the smaller tool head ribbon cable connector.

The strain gauge is a digital output, coming from small MCU on toolhead board, resulting in digital pulse, when the load is increased from previous.
The Y end stop line doubles as cooler fan control.
